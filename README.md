# maintenance_bot

This is an extremely simple discord bot that is used when a bot you made has to go offline for maintenance.

For example when you are deploying an update for your bot, or if you noticed some vulnerability in your code that needs fixing immediately.

With this bot that problem is fixed! Simple enter the details of your bot and your support server or another support link,
then just run it and have it handled automatically.

Reccomended is that if your bot has to go down for maintenance multiple times, or if you just want to be sure, you should add you bot details
in `Config.cs` then you can build the file and simply run the resulting executable when you need to put your bot as under maintenance again.
